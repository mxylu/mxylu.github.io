  <p>Hi, welcome to my page! I'm Michael.</p>
  <p>I'm currently studying investments in renewable energy technology.</p>

  <p>I developed various interests throughout the years. Currently I play weiqi (go), rock climb, and study blockchains. In the past, I painted, wrote short stories, performed classical piano, competed in weiqi (go), and a few other things.</p>
