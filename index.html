  <p>Hi, I'm Michael and welcome to my page.</p>
  <p>My professional adventures carried me to stints in web developing, project management, data analytics, banking, and consulting. </p>
  <p>I developed various interests throughout the years. Currently I play weiqi (go), rock climb, study alternative energy sources and blockchains. </p>
  <p>I also <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/mxylu">read</a> a lot.</p>
  <p>In a past life I painted/clay-sculpted, wrote short stories, performed classical piano, competed in weiqi (go), and a few other things.</p>
