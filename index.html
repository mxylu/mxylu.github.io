  <p> Hi and welcome to my page, I'm Michael. </p>
  <p>I currently add value to my clients' financial advisory practice by providing actionable economic insights, deep product analysis, and asset allocation best practices at RBC Global Asset Management. I am also completing my MBA at the <a href="https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/" target="_blank">Richard Ivey School of Business</a> at the University of Western Ontario, expecting to graduate in January 2022. </p>
  <p>My prior roles covered a wide range of responsibilities including benefits consulting, building predictive models to reduce credit/loan losses, and product management. I graduated with a bachelors of mathematics from the University of Waterloo in 2013 but found my innate passion for business development and the financial markets in 2017. </p>
  <p>My interests are many, but limited time only allows the luxury of a few. Currently I am <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/mxylu" target="_blank">reading</a> a lot, doing yoga, enjoy taking <a href="https://www.instagram.com/emperiox/" target="_blank">scenery</a> shots, and follow developments in the blockchain and energy storage space. Previously I spent time (and money) on Go (weiqi), rock climbing, half-marathons, Assassin's Creed (video game), EDM concerts, playing basketball, Starcraft/Command & Conquer/Rome Total War, and a few others. </p>
